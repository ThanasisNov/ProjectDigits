Digit Classification Using CNN
This project involves building, training, and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using pixel data. The steps followed in this process are detailed below:

Load the Data
The dataset contains images of handwritten digits, where:

Each digit (0-9) is represented by 200 examples.
The first 200 examples are labeled as '0', the next 200 as '1', and so on.
Preprocess the Data
To prepare the data for the model:

Normalization: The pixel values, initially ranging from 0 to 6, are scaled to a range of 0 to 1. This ensures consistency in the intensity of the ink, making the images easier to compare.
Reshaping: Each image is reshaped into a specific size and format (15x16 pixels, with a single color channel) that the model can process efficiently.
One-hot Encoding: The labels are converted into a format that the model can understand, making it easier for the model to learn and make predictions.
Split the Data
The dataset is split into two parts:

Training Set: Used to train the model.
Testing Set: Used to evaluate the model's performance. This helps in understanding how well the model has learned and can generalize to new, unseen data.
Build the CNN Model
The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Conv2D Layers: Act like the model's eyes, focusing on small parts of the image to identify patterns and details.
MaxPooling2D Layers: Reduce the size of the images, making them more manageable for the model to process.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D image into a 1D array, enabling the model to process the data for classification.
Dense Layers: These fully connected layers help the model make decisions based on the features identified in the previous layers.
Dropout Layer: Introduces some randomness by "forgetting" parts of the data during training, which helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well.
Train the Model
The model is trained using the training dataset:

During training, the model makes predictions and learns from its mistakes.
The process is repeated multiple times (epochs) to improve the model's accuracy and performance.
Evaluate the Model
The model's performance is assessed using the testing dataset:

Accuracy: Measures how many images the model correctly identifies.
Error Rate: Indicates the percentage of images the model misclassifies.
This evaluation acts as a final exam, showcasing the model's ability to recognize digits after training.
This process helps the model learn to recognize digits from images, similar to how you learn to recognize letters and numbers through practice.
